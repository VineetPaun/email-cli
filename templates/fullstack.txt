Hi {{ name }},

I’m reaching out regarding full stack engineering roles at {{ company }}.

I work across frontend and backend systems with a backend-first engineering mindset. My stack includes Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL.

I’ve built:
- End-to-end features from schema design to production UI
- SEO-optimized SSR applications
- Secure authentication and authorization systems
- Tool-integrated AI systems with multi-agent coordination
- Backend services designed with observability and scale in mind

I enjoy owning features holistically — ensuring architectural clarity, performance efficiency, and long-term maintainability.

If relevant, I’d be glad to share specific implementations.

Thank you for your time.
