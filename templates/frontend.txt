Hi {{ name }},

I’m reaching out regarding frontend engineering opportunities at {{ company }}.

I build high-performance, production-grade interfaces using React, Next.js, and TypeScript, with strong emphasis on rendering performance, accessibility, and architectural consistency.

My recent work includes:
- Server-side rendering and SEO optimization in Next.js
- Component abstraction with strict typing and design constraints
- State normalization and predictable data flows
- Real-time UI systems integrated with backend services
- Bundle size optimization and performance profiling

I focus on building frontend systems that scale across teams, not just features.

If relevant, I’d be glad to share projects demonstrating performance improvements and architectural decisions.
