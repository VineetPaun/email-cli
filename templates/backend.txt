Hi {{ name }},

I’m writing to express interest in backend engineering roles at {{ company }}.

I design backend systems with focus on correctness, scalability, and operational reliability.

My experience includes:
- Designing RESTful and event-driven services in Node.js
- Data modeling for high-read and write-heavy workloads (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- Authentication systems (JWT, RBAC)
- Background workers and queue-based processing
- Observability practices (structured logging, metrics-first thinking)
- Building AI-powered multi-agent CLI systems with tool orchestration

I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, infrastructure-level challenges, and backend systems where reliability and performance are critical.

If useful, I’d be happy to share architecture breakdowns of systems I’ve built.

Thank you for your consideration.
