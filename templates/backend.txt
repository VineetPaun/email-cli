Hi {{ name }},

I am reaching out because I am interested in backend opportunities at {{ company }}.

I work on APIs, distributed systems, data modeling, and production reliability with a focus on maintainability and scale.

If useful, I can share examples of backend systems I built and how I handle performance, observability, and safe deployments.
